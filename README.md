# Elasticsearch Hands on Session

## What is !ElasticSearch?
- Not for primary data storage
- Not an SQL DB, no support for
  - Transactions
  - Sub-queries
  - Joins

## What is ElasticSearch?
- It's a software/service/tool to do fast textual search
- Wrapper written in JAVA over **Lucene** (understatement)
- Interface through a REST API
- May look like a NoSQL DB
  - Stores data in JSON documents


## What's Lucene?
- Full-text search library in Java
- Inverted Index
  - Lucene is able to achieve fast search responses because, instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index instead. This would be the equivalent of retrieving pages in a book related to a keyword by searching the index at the back of a book, as opposed to searching the words in each page of the book.
  - This type of index is called an inverted index, because it inverts a page-centric data structure (page->words) to a keyword-centric data structure (word->pages).

## Why or When to use ElasticSearch?
- When you have a lot of text-based data and want to provide keyword based search.
- To add search functionality in a website. Think search bars in amazon/zomato/<insert any e-commerce platform here>
- Sift through your partners chat data, to find out whom they are flirting with? ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‰
